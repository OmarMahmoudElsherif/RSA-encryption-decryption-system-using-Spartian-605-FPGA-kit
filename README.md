- Description
RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. A public-key 
cryptosystem means that data is encrypted and decrypted using two different keys: private key and 
public key, respectively. This provides added data security but adds the complexity of the sharing and 
generating the private and public keys between sender and receiver.
